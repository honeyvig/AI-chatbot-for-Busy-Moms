=====================
To develop the proof-of-concept chatbot for busy moms, we'll break the development process into manageable tasks. The focus is on implementing scheduling assistance, text communication via SMS, and integrating with popular calendar platforms (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook Calendar).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the Python code for this MVP:
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, you need to install the following Python libraries to handle the various functionalities:

pip install openai twilio google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client requests flask

    OpenAI for GPT-based conversational AI.
    Twilio for SMS communication.
    Google API for Google Calendar integration.
    Flask for creating the web server and handling routes.

Step 2: Set Up Calendar Integrations
Google Calendar Integration

You'll need to create a project on Google Cloud, enable the Google Calendar API, and get the credentials to access the Google Calendar API.

from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Define the scope for Google Calendar access
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events']

def google_calendar_auth():
    creds = None
    if os.path.exists('token.json'):
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                'credentials.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())
    return build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds)

This function authenticates the user and grants the necessary access to Google Calendar using OAuth.
Outlook Calendar Integration (via Microsoft Graph API)

Microsoft Graph API provides access to Outlook Calendar. You'll need to register your app in Azure and configure the API permissions to access the calendar.

import msal
import requests

# Microsoft Azure configuration
CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret'
TENANT_ID = 'your_tenant_id'
SCOPES = ['https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite']

# Authenticate with Microsoft
def get_outlook_access_token():
    app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
        CLIENT_ID,
        authority=f'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}',
        client_credential=CLIENT_SECRET
    )
    result = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=SCOPES)
    return result['access_token']

def get_outlook_calendar(token):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

This will authenticate the user via Microsoft’s OAuth2 system and fetch events from their Outlook Calendar.
Step 3: Integrate Twilio for SMS Communication

Twilio will be used for two-way communication. You can use it to send and receive text messages from the user.

from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio credentials
TWILIO_PHONE = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
TWILIO_SID = 'your_twilio_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'

# Initialize Twilio client
client = Client(TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

def send_sms(to, message):
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE,
        to=to
    )
    return message.sid

This function sends SMS messages using Twilio. The chatbot will use this to send reminders or communicate scheduling information.
Step 4: Create Flask Server and Chatbot Logic

Here’s where we integrate everything and use GPT-based models for generating responses based on user input.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

# Flask app setup
app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

@app.route('/sms', methods=['POST'])
def handle_sms():
    incoming_message = request.form['Body']
    from_number = request.form['From']

    # Generate response using OpenAI
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"User: {incoming_message}\nBot: ",
        max_tokens=150
    )
    reply = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Send the response back via Twilio
    send_sms(from_number, reply)

    return '', 200

@app.route('/schedule', methods=['POST'])
def handle_schedule():
    user_message = request.json['message']
    user_phone = request.json['phone']
    
    # Process user scheduling request
    if "add event" in user_message.lower():
        # Example: Add an event to Google Calendar
        calendar_service = google_calendar_auth()
        event = {
            'summary': 'Scheduled Task',
            'location': 'Home',
            'description': 'A simple test event',
            'start': {
                'dateTime': '2024-12-06T09:00:00-07:00',
                'timeZone': 'America/Los_Angeles',
            },
            'end': {
                'dateTime': '2024-12-06T10:00:00-07:00',
                'timeZone': 'America/Los_Angeles',
            },
        }
        created_event = calendar_service.events().insert(calendarId='primary', body=event).execute()
        send_sms(user_phone, f"Your event has been scheduled: {created_event['summary']} at {created_event['start']['dateTime']}")
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of the Code:

    Flask App: We create a simple Flask web app to handle SMS and scheduling requests. The /sms endpoint listens for incoming messages from Twilio, processes them, and responds using OpenAI's GPT model. The /schedule endpoint processes requests to add events to a calendar.
    OpenAI Integration: The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses based on user input. It’s designed to handle scheduling-related queries, especially those relevant to moms.
    Twilio SMS: The bot can send and receive SMS messages using Twilio. The response is generated based on the AI model's understanding of the user’s query.
    Google Calendar API: Google Calendar integration allows the chatbot to add events to the user's calendar based on the information provided in the user’s message.

Step 5: Deployment

You can deploy the chatbot on any cloud platform such as AWS, Heroku, or GCP. Make sure to secure the endpoints with HTTPS, and ensure that the calendar credentials and Twilio API keys are kept safe in environment variables.
Conclusion

This proof-of-concept MVP provides a functional chatbot with scheduling capabilities for busy moms. It integrates seamlessly with popular calendar platforms, communicates via SMS, and uses GPT for generative AI-based responses. You can expand the functionality as you gather user feedback during testing phases and add more features, such as media handling, payment gateway integration, and enhanced personalization.
